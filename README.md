# StockWise: Predictive Trading Analytics

**StockWise** is a comprehensive stock market analysis tool designed to help users make informed decisions by analyzing stock prices over a specified period. This project utilizes algorithmic strategies to predict potential profits and optimize stock transactions based on historical data.

## Features

- **Daily Stock Price Analysis**: Import and analyze stock prices over a user-defined period.
- **Budget Management**: Incorporate budget constraints to simulate realistic trading scenarios.
- **Profit Prediction**: Calculate potential profits using a dynamic trading strategy.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Visualize stock price trends and trading decisions with graphical plots.
- **Decision Support**: Receive optimal buy/sell recommendations based on price movements and transaction history.

## Project Structure

- **Input Handling**: 
  - Accepts daily stock prices from a text file.
  - Allows users to input a budget for the trading period.
  
- **Algorithm Implementation**:
  - Analyzes stock prices to identify key transaction points.
  - Predicts potential profits by simulating buy/sell operations.
  
- **Graphical Output**:
  - Utilizes graphics libraries to plot stock price movements and visualize transactions.
  
- **Transaction Records**:
  - Maintains a detailed record of all buy/sell operations.
  - Provides feedback on whether transactions fit within the budget.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as GCC.
- **Graphics Library**: For graphical output, install a graphics library compatible with your system, such as BGI.

### Running the Program

1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   gcc stockwise.c -o stockwise -lgraph
   ```
2. **Prepare the Input File**:
   - Create a text file (`stock_prices.txt`) containing daily stock prices, with each price separated by a comma.
   
3. **Execute the Program**:
   ```bash
   ./stockwise
   ```
4. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Enter the month and year of the transactions.
   - Input your budget and the initial stock details.
   - Choose to buy, sell, or exit based on the programâ€™s recommendations.

### Example

After running the program, you'll receive outputs like:

- **Amount Spent**: The total amount spent or earned during the transactions.
- **Stock Value at Hand**: The current value of the stocks held.
- **Predicted Profit**: The calculated profit based on the predicted transactions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implement predictive models to enhance trading recommendations.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Fetch real-time stock prices for dynamic analysis.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly GUI for better interaction and visualization.
